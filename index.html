Atri Mandal received his Masters degree in Information and Computer Science from University of California, Irvine(USA) in 2004 and is currently employed as a Senior Research Engineer at IBM Research,India . He has over 17 years of experience in software development and research and has worked on many interesting and complex research problems in the areas of <b>AIOps, NLP and machine-learning</b>. <br> <br>
His current research work in AIOps focuses on the problem of localizing operational and software faults by mining distributed execution logs from micro-services in a cloud-native application. He has also extensively worked on related problems like anomaly detection/root cause analysis from logs, natural language based ticket classification and incident similarity. His work on “Automated Dispatch of Helpdesk Email Tickets” won the <b>Deployed Paper Award</b> at IAAI-2019 (Hawaii, USA). He has 10 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier journals and conferences and has filed <b>8 patents with IBM</b> so far. <br> <br>
Outside his regular work and research Atri has a lot of interest in two other things - food and travel. His passion for travel has already taken him across the length and breadth of the world - to as many as 18 countries across 4 continents. As far as food is concerned, the interest lies primarily in eating and not cooking, although he is trying his hand a bit these days. Last but not the least he is also an ardent cricket fan and a maths enthusiast.
