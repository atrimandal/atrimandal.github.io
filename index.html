<p>
    I did my MS in information and Computer Science from University of California, Irvine (USA) and am currently employed as Senior Research Engineer at IBM Research, India. I have over 17 years of experience in software development and research and have worked on many interesting and complex research problems in the areas of AI, Big Data and DevOps.
In IBM Research I have researched on AI assisted methods to automate various helpdesk functions like ticket assignment and resolution, chatbot conversation, AIOps etc. I have worked on the full AI lifecycle starting from design/implementation of ML models to deployment in a cloud native environment. Recently I am working on infusing AI in IT Operations solutions for solving problems like fault localization, incident similarity and root cause analysis. 
While in IBM, I have also extensively explored AI based techniques to assist in continuous monitoring of cloud-based applications in a DevOps ecosystem. I have played the role of DevOps Champ for the India Research Lab in which I was involved in defining the best practices around code testing and deployment for easy reuse and adoption.
 
As a researcher I have published in top international conferences and journals. Our work on "Automated dispatch of Helpdesk Email Tickets" won the prestigious IAAI Deployment Award at AAAI-2019. Our log analytics paper in KDD-2016 was adjudged the IRL Best paper award and was also included in the list of Top 20 projects at IRL. I also have 6 disclosures accepted for filing with IBM.
