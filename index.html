Atri Mandal received his Masters degree in Information and Computer Science from University of California, Irvine(USA) in 2004 and is currently employed as Director of Machine Learning at HEAL. He has over 19 years of experience in software development and research and has worked on many interesting and complex research problems in the areas of <b>AIOps, NLP and machine-learning</b>. <br> <br>
His current work focuses on building the next generation AIOps product which can predict software problems in advance using AI and also suggest preventive actions. He has extensively worked on related problems in the AIOps domain like anomaly detection in logs/metrics, fault localization, ticket routing, IT support chatbots and so on. He is an IEEE Senior Member and has authored multiple  peer-reviewed publications in top-tier journals and conferences. He has won numerous awards for his research work including the <b>Deployed Paper Award</b> at AAAI-2019 (Hawaii, USA). He has also filed <b>14 patents (7 granted, rest in various stages of filing)</b> so far. <br> <br>
Outside his regular work and research Atri has a lot of interest in two other things - food and travel. His passion for travel has already taken him across the length and breadth of the world - to as many as 19 countries across 5 continents. As far as food is concerned, the interest lies primarily in eating and not cooking, although he is trying his hand a bit these days. Last but not the least he is also an ardent cricket fan and a maths enthusiast.

<h3>Industry Experience</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
   <li> <b>[IBM Research: 2014-2016, 2019-2020]</b> Led a team of researchers and developers to develop log monitoring solutions like anomaly detection, fault localization, RCA and trace mining.  This work has already become an integral part of multiple IBM products like IToA-LA and Watson AIOps and has won multiple internal and external awards like OTAA (2016) and IRL Best Paper Award (2017). The work was also selected among Top-20 projects at IRL. 
    <li> <b>[IBM Research: 2017-2019]</b> Research lead for “Cognitive Assignment Engine” – which automates IT helpdesk functions like ticket creation, assignment, incident similarity and resolution. The engine uses an ensemble-classifier based method augmented with an innovatively designed rule engine for optimal accuracy and coverage. The solution was adopted by several international clients across multiple geographies and has served more than 3 million tickets in production. This work won the OTAA award (2017) and Best Deployed Paper Award at IAAI-2019. The work was later extended to include information extracted from other modalities like images. 
    <li> <b>[Yahoo!: 2011-2014]</b> Technical Lead for a team which designed and deployed the next generation GSLB backend for Yahoo’s content delivery framework. The new solution used a predictive-analytics based algorithm replacing the previous static geo-based one. This GSLB backend currently supports Flickr and Yahoo! Screen and is used by millions of people worldwide.
